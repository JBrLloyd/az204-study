## Skills Measured

***NOTE:*** The bullets that appear below each of the skills measured are intended to illustrate how
we are assessing that skill. This list is not definitive or exhaustive.

***NOTE:*** In most cases, exams do NOT cover preview features, and some features will only be
added to an exam when they are GA (General Availability).
